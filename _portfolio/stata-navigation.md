An image-based system for navigating MIT's Stata Center. The system uses ResNet-18 with a custom classification head to identify a user's location on the first floor of the Stata Center. Then, we determine the best route to the user's location using Dijkstra's algorithm. The location identification step achieves a top-1 accuracy of 46.5%, a top-5 accuracy of 63.8%, and a median error of 29 feet on our test set; overall, this performance results in high-quality navigation instructions.
