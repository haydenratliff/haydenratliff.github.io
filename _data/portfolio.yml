- title: Knowledge Graph Synthesis Chatbot
  short_description: A chatbot that uses context in Pfizer's Knowledge Graph to answer questions, minimizing hallucination and taking advantage of the graph database's structure.
  full_description: |
    A dual-LLM approach to answering questions with context using Graph [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/), or [GraphRAG](https://neo4j.com/blog/graphrag-manifesto/).

    *Methods:*
    1. The user asks a question to the chatbot.
    2. The chatbot uses *[TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0)* to translate the question to Cypher Query Language using few-shot learning.
    3. The chatbot executes the generated query on a Neo4j Knowledge Graph database to retrieve context for the question.
    4. The chatbot uses *[deepset/roberta-base-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2)* to answer the question using the context extracted from the database. If no context is extracted or the query was invalid, answers "I don't know."
    5. The chatbot returns the answer to the user.

    *Results:*
    - Projected to save up to 14 minutes per question asked for Pfizer manufacturers.
    - Hallucination free on small testing dataset.
    - Infers answer from the database.
    - Works in 10-15 seconds on laptop GPU.

    This project was conducted in collaboration with Anne Castille Buisson, as part of our MIT Capstone Project with Pfizer's Operations and Insights Team.

- title: Stata Navigation
  short_description: A Computer Vision-based navigation system for MIT's Stata Center. Uses ResNet-18 to identify a user's location and propose directions to their destination.
  full_description: |
    An image-based system for navigating MIT's Stata Center, a notoriously complex building.

    *Methods:*
    1. The user uploads an image from the first floor of the Stata Center and a desired destination.
    2. The system uses *[ResNet-18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html)* to identify the user's location based on the uploaded image.
    3. The system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the user's location and their destination.
    4. The system returns navigation instructions to the user.

    *Results:*
    - The location identification step achieves a top-1 accuracy of 46.5%, a top-5 accuracy of 63.8%, and a median error of 29 feet on our test set.
    - Using the location identified by ResNet-18, the system produces high-quality navigation instructions, helping the user reach their destination easier.

    This project was conducted in collaboration with Krish Datta and Sara Pasquino, as part of MIT's 6.8300: Advances in Computer Vision course.
