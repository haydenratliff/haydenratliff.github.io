- title: Knowledge Graph Synthesis Chatbot
  short_description: A chatbot that uses context in Pfizer's Knowledge Graph to answer questions, minimizing hallucination and taking advantage of the graph database's structure.
  full_description: |
    A dual-LLM approach to answering questions with context using Graph [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/), or [GraphRAG](https://neo4j.com/blog/graphrag-manifesto/).

    *Method:*
    1. The user asks the chatbot a question.
    2. The chatbot uses *[TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0)* to translate the question to Cypher Query Language using few-shot learning.
    3. The chatbot executes the generated query on a Neo4j Knowledge Graph database to retrieve context for the question.
    4. The chatbot uses *[deepset/roberta-base-squad2](https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2)* to answer the question using the context extracted from the database. If no context is extracted or the query was invalid, answers "I don't know."
    5. The chatbot returns the answer to the user.

    *Results:*
    - Projected to save up to 14 minutes per question asked for Pfizer manufacturers.
    - Hallucination free on small testing dataset.
    - Infers answer from the database.
    - Works in 10-15 seconds on laptop GPU.

    This project was conducted in collaboration with Anne Castille Buisson, as part of our MIT Capstone with Pfizer's Operations and Insights Team.

- title: Knowledge Transfer Automation
  short_description: A system that automates the identification of relevant documents for Pfizer manufacturers. Saves $5.3M per year by reducing manual work 90% for 1,000 users.
  full_description: |
    An automated document classification tool that identifies documents relevant to manufacturing, displaying relevant documents in an internal search engine.

    *Method:*
    1. The system extracts raw text from the first two pages of documents using [Optical Character Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/).
    2. The system embeds document text with *[allenai/biomed_roberta_base](https://huggingface.co/allenai/biomed_roberta_base)*, a version of *[RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)* fine-tuned with biomedical research papers.
    3. The system classifies document embeddings with a *[HistXGBoost](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier.html)* classificaiton model trained on 33K documents from seven Pfizer molecules.
      - Steps 1-3 are run in parallel on AWS EC2, which classifies each document in less than one second.
    4. The system writes classification probabilities to Pfizer's Knowledge Graph database with an ETL script.
    5. Document classification probabilities are read by the "Wizer Pfizer" search engine and displayed to manufacturers through an easy-to-use user interface.
      - Document classification probabilities are shown to manufacturers as a binary "relevant" or "not relevant" label. 
      - Inside Wizer, manufacturers can provide feedback on the model's classification results. This feedback will be used to retrain the model in the future.

    *Results:*
    - Reduces the time required to process documents for one of Pfizer's molecules from 9 months to 10 minutes.
    - Saved 1,200 hours of manual work by processing three molecules (~3K documents) in Summer 2024.
    - Projected to save $5.3M per year by reducing manual work 90% for 1,000 users by the end of 2024.
    - Will be used to process documents from 100% of Pfizer's new molecules, starting in 2025.

- title: Stata Navigation
  short_description: A Computer Vision-based navigation system for MIT's Stata Center. Uses ResNet-18 to identify a user's location and propose directions to their destination.
  full_description: |
    An image-based system for navigating MIT's Stata Center, a notoriously complex building.

    *Method:*
    1. The user uploads an image from the first floor of the Stata Center and a desired destination.
    2. The system uses *[ResNet-18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html)* to identify the user's location based on the uploaded image.
    3. The system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the user's location and their destination.
    4. The system returns navigation instructions to the user.

    *Results:*
    - The location identification step achieves a top-1 accuracy of 46.5%, a top-5 accuracy of 63.8%, and a median error of 29 feet on our test set.
    - Using the location identified by ResNet-18, the system produces high-quality navigation instructions, helping the user reach their destination easier.

    This project was conducted in collaboration with Krish Datta and Sara Pasquino, as part of MIT's 6.8300: Advances in Computer Vision course.

- title: Optimizing Cancer Center Throughput
  short_description: Building a strategy to increase capacity at a Virginia cancer center by 3%. Co-authored publication won Best Paper Award, Health Track at SIEDS 2023.
  full_description: |
    A systems-based approach to increasing throughput at a central Virginia cancer infusion center.

    *Methods:*
    - Conducted live observations and interviews with nurses, schedulers, and pharmacists.
    - Built a process map representation of the infusion center to visualize process inefficiencies.
    - Calculated descriptive statistics to determine infusion chair utilization rate.
    - Trained stepwise linear regression models to understand drivers of appointment length and drug mixing time.
    - Used decision modeling and stakeholder input to identify drugs causing pharmacy bottleneck.

    *Results:*
    - Proposed strategy to improve capacity while holding nurse staffing constant due to the ongoing nurse shortage.
    - Found that capacity could be increased by 3% by decreasing the scheduled buffer time for follow-up appointments by 10 minutes, saving 820 minutes per day.
    - Identified chair idle time as a key driver of inefficiency; proposed five candidate drugs for a drug pre-mixing pilot study to reduce chair idle time.

    This research was conducted in collaboration with Anna Bustamante and Devon Zavacky and advised by Prof. Rupa Valdez, as part of our UVA Systems Engineering Capstone.

- title: Improving Sustainability of Urban Deliveries
  short_description: Parking availability information reduces drive distance and emissions for urban deliveries. Acknowledged contributor for publication in Scientific Reports 2022.
  full_description: |
    A research study on the impact of parking availability information on "cruising" for parking, the distance delivery drivers drive to find parking, in urban areas.

    *Methods:*
    - previously: magnetic sensors in the ground before study
    - these do curb availability information real-time
    - helped with methodology
    - Delivery mock manifests
    - 8 drivers, 24 routes, with and without parking information on iPad
    - rented UHaul and led data collection, using iPhone to collect data in urban Seattle neighborhood
    - post-processing of delivery drives
    - calculated drive and segment statistics
      - one segment is a drive or walking segment

    *Results:*
    - Study found that information does reduce crusiing for parking
    - essentially, helps drivers decide how greedy to be when looking for parking

    This research was conducted in collaboration with Giacomo Dalla Chiara and Fiete XX, as part of a research assistantship at UW's Urban Freight Lab advised by Prof. Anne Goodchild.
