Currently, I'm pursuing a [Master's of Business Analytics](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/explore-program) at MIT, a Data Science degree focused on practical applications of ML, AI, and Optimization. At MIT, I conducted research advised by Prof. [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu/), and used ML to solve problems for Lineage Logistics and Pfizer.

On the personal side, I've played collegiate Ultimate Frisbee for the past five years, and am an avid hiker and fisherman.

So what's next after MIT? I'm currently looking for role in the Data Science industry in the Washington, DC area. [something else here]
