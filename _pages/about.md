Right now, I'm pursuing a [Master's of Business Analytics](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics/explore-program) at MIT, a Data Science degree focused on practical applications of ML, AI, and Optimization. At MIT, I've conducted research advised by Prof. [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu/) and worked for Lineage Logistics and Pfizer.

On the personal side, I've played collegiate Ultimate Frisbee for the past five years, and am an avid hiker and fisherman.

What's Next?

I'm excited to be graduating from MIT in August 2024. Currently, I'm seeking a Data Science or ML role for fall 2024. If you'd like to get in contact, please reach out to me at [hratliff@mit.edu](mailto:hratliff@mit.edu).
